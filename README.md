HoloColorPicker slides
======================

[Slides][1] for a short introduction to the Android library [HoloColorPicker][2].


This presentation was created using [reveal.js][3]. The "extension" to display links as QR codes
is a hack (Works on my Machine(tm)) that uses [jquery-qrcode][4] which in turn depends on
[QRCode for JavaScript][5] and [jQuery][6].
