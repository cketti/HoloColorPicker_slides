HoloColorPicker slides
======================

Slides for a short introduction to the Android library [HoloColorPicker][1].


This presentation was created using [reveal.js][2]. The "extension" to display links as QR codes
is a hack (Works on my Machine(tm)) that uses [jquery-qrcode][3] which in turn depends on
[QRCode for JavaScript][4] and [jQuery][5].
