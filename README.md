HoloColorPicker slides
======================

Slides for a short introduction to the Android library HoloColorPicker.


This presentation was created using reveal.js. The "extension" to display links as QR codes
is a hack (Works on my machine(tm)) that uses jquery-qrcode which in turn depends on
"QRCode for JavaScript" and jQuery.
